this is a java final project that requires an on screen keyboard to type cities with thier descrption and some special keys like space or shift to convert all characters to lowercase, 
and edit as much as we want then update the older version and then display all added cities with their description in a seperate panel.
i have included the solution source code and the requirements file and three txt files, one for the cities, one for the descriptions, and one for both of them combined.
